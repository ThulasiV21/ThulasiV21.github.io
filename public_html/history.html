                <p>Welcome to the story of a boy named internet. It all started way back in the 1960’s when the then
                    President of USA,
                    Dwight D. Eisenhower, created a team called ARPA, who would take charge of space programs (which also
                    included
                    computer science) to beat the Russians on space research and technology. This space program was then
                    taken over by
                    NASA and the computer science research came to a dead end until a Graduate at MIT, J.C.R. Licklider came
                    up with an
                    idea of applying queueing theory to data transmission. The whole idea revolving around the concept on
                    packages of
                    data would queue or line up at the nodes of a communications network as they transited through. This
                    helped him in
                    detecting the overall speed of the network which he later improved using two techniques,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Demand access</li>
                    <li>Distributed control</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Using the first technique he could let a node decide to receive information on demand, this helped to
                    effectively
                    share resource between data networks. The second technique meant that no one switch can control rather
                    all switches
                    should have shared control (it should decide the routing procedure, should decide how much traffic is
                    allowed in,
                    where it’s going).</p>

                <p>During the same time America was in midst of a war. Their soul communication during this period was
                    through
                    telephones and if this network was bombed the military were left stranded, unable to counterattack. To
                    resolve this
                    biggest issue, Paul Baran was hired, to build a communication network that was indestructible. After few
                    experimental ideas, the team finally found the one that would work and formed the foundation for what
                    now is called
                    the ‘internet’. The idea was to chop up each message into small equal size pieces called packets, each
                    packet was
                    like a post card with a to and from address. These packets would traverse through the network from
                    sender to receiver
                    through already existing path and there would not be one dedicated path, and this was decided by the
                    nodes
                    throughout the packets’ journey. Unlike the post office, each node would keep a copy of the packets,
                    which would be
                    sent repeatedly until it successfully reached the next node. This idea was perfect because even if a
                    path was
                    destroyed, there were other paths these packets could traverse through unlike the telephone lines, where
                    the whole
                    network would collapse if one circuit was destroyed.</p>

                <p>By 1962, enough research was done to show a viable computer network could be built but implementing one
                    had to wait 7 yrs until 1969. The first computer network stem from the
                    frustrations of a single ARPA scientist Bob Taylor. Taylor along with Larry Roberts and with a little
                    help from a
                    fellow engineer built the first network design, the ARPANET, now popularly known as the ‘Internet’ and
                    it was
                    brought to life by BBN, a team that created the EMS for the ARPANET on Jan 1, 1969. On Sep 1, 1969, the
                    first piece
                    of hardware was created for the computer network. By the end of 1969, all the 4 sites (UCLA, Stanford,
                    University of
                    California at Santa Barbara and university of Utah) were interconnected, and ARPANET was a success! By
                    April 1971,
                    it had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network. Until now, ARPANET was used only to transfer
                    files between
                    systems until a new killer capability called the email was added to it. Raymond Samuel Tomlinson, in the
                    same year
                    created electronic mail, added this functionality to ARPANET and also gave the world a new icon, @. The
                    ARPANET
                    stayed the same with increasing networks until 20 years later, in 1973, two people Vint Cerf and Bob
                    Kahn teamed up
                    together to develop a set of rules or procedures known as TCP/IP protocol. This was finally perfected in
                    1983 and
                    adopted as the universal standard, to interconnect all the disparate systems over the network, a common
                    network of
                    interconnected networks.</p>

                <p>The ARPANET was developed as a tool for defense research and restricted to select universities and think
                    tanks
                    engaged in government projects, but on June 9 1992, Congress passed a bill taking the internet out of
                    exclusive
                    hands of the government and into the public and following November, President Bush signed it into
                    law.</p>
                <p>Around the same time the internet was used to look up information for research or come in a group to
                    solve problems
                    which was difficult until a physicist named Tim Berners Lee at the CERN research Institute created an
                    easier way to
                    search the web of contents. He developed a software that could more easily follow threads of knowledge
                    within
                    information stored throughout the internet. This Criss crossing of myriad threads of information across
                    the globe
                    over the internet reminded him of the web and hence named his software as the ‘World wide web’. This
                    functionality
                    was made even easier and user friendly, i.e to browse the world wide web through a software known as
                    Mosaic. In 1993 at
                    the University of Illinois by a 22-year-old student named Marc Andreessen developed Mosaic, which was
                    later
                    commercialized by Netscape, became the very signature of today’s internet.</p>
