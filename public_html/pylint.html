            <h4 class="adjust-margin">In Python</h4>
            <p>To all new programmers out there, here are some <span><b>tips and tricks</b></span> to understand the
                <span><b>what</b></span> and <span><b>why</b></span> of pylint and finally on
                <span><b>how</b></span> to implement pylint.</p>

            <h4>What is pylint?</h4>
            <p class="adjust-margin">
                Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks
                for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how
                particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.
            </p>

            <p>The Python community has formalized some recommended programming styles to help everyone write code
                in a common, agreed-upon style that makes the most sense for shared code. This style is captured in
                <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank" title="PEP8"> PEP 8</a>, the
                <span><b>"Style Guide for Python Code"</b></span>. Pylint can be a quick and easy way of seeing if
                your code has captured the essence of PEP 8 and is therefore friendly to other potential users.</p>

            <p>Pylint will display a number of messages as it analyzes the code and it can also be used for
                displaying some statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files. The
                messages are classified under various categories such as errors and warnings.</p>

            <h4>Why should I use pylint?</h4>
            <p class="adjust-margin">
                Dynamic language like Python does not have a compiler that’ll catch production impacting bugs for
                you and plus helps you make your code more user readable and hence a linter like pylint would come
                to your rescue. Pylint has a lot of useful errors and warning, but also a whole lot of highly
                opinionated assumptions about how your code should look. And fundamentally it treats both opinions
                and objective problems the same way. There’s a distinction between warnings and errors, but both
                useful and useless stuff is in the warning category. Pylint can tell you where you may have run
                astray and point you in the direction to figure out what you have done and how to do better.
                You can run Pylint in a mode where it only complains about obvious errors—but then you’ll miss out
                on some of the important warnings that make Pylint so useful.

            <h4>How to implement pylint</h4>
            <p class="adjust-margin">
                First step is to install pylint and there are 2 ways to do it.
            <ol>
                <li>Python packages where it can be installed through pip</li>
                <ul class="ul-python">
                    <li>Command: pip install pylint (or it can be added in your requirements.txt that will be
                        installed by your interpreter)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Source distribution installation</li>
                <ul class="ul-python">
                    <li>By extracting the tarball: go to the extracted dir and run cmd: python setup.py install</li>
                    <li>In the editable mode using cmd: python setup.py develop</li>
                </ul>
                <li>For all the different IDEs there are specific ways to integrate pylint. <a

                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Once you have installed it, it is a good idea to run pylint for a small section of your code to first
                understand what and how the output would look like. You can do that by calling pylint in the command
                line by either just hitting the cmd as pylint, which would traverse over all of your files and
                folders to check. Hence to make it easier you could comment all your lines of code except for a
                single file and run pylint.</p>

            <h4>Pylint report</h4>
            <p class="adjust-margin">
                Don’t be alarmed by the report you see at first as Pylint was created or in other words is only a
                way to mold you into a better programmer and to open your mind into the depths of programming. But
                be aware of the fact that pylint does not know any better than you, so be mindful of the changes
                that you would need to make or not make based on your project requirements.
            </p>

            <p class="adjust-margin-bottom">Using the default text output, the message format is :
                MESSAGE_TYPE:LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE</p>
            <p class="adjust-margin">There are 5 kind of message types:</p>
            <p>
            <ul class="ul-python">
                <li>(C) convention, for programming standard violation</li>
                <li>(R) refactor, for bad code smell</li>
                <li>(W) warning, for python specific problems</li>
                <li>(E) error, for probable bugs in the code</li>
                <li>(F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing further processing.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>If you are using Pycharm, the pylint report would look something like the image on your right in the
                command line. It will tell you the error or warning is in which file of which folder, which line in
                that file and lastly the error or warning message. The report is pretty much straight forward. There
                are a list of error/warning messages, and you can look it up <a

            <p><span><b>Note:</b></span> If you've considered what pylint has to say and decided that for this
                class, the code or logic you have is appropriate and reasonable, you can both suppress the error and
                indicate that you've considered the issue by adding a disabling comment to your class.
                <span><b>For eg:</b></span>
