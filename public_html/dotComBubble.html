    <p>In a new phase of capitalism, the age of e commerce, using the world wide web was flourishing. Just like how most
        of the startups started in a garage, so did two companies called Amazon.com and eBay in this phase, back in the
        1990s, creating a whole new model of e-commerce. The business plan of Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos and launched in the
        summer of 1995, was simple but very rewarding. What started as a platform for selling books is now the biggest
        e-commerce platform around the globe. During the same time, Pierre Omidyar, a software programmer founded eBay
        with a simple idea of making an online auction site for regular people making use of the web. The basic functions of
        Ebay were create an item, list an item, get a list of all the items that have been created, and bid on an item. Both
        companies cherished early successes right after their launch and their numbers increased exponentially quarter
        after quarter.</p>

    <p>This success is greatly explained by two laws working hand-in-hand, Moore's law and Metcalfe's law. In
        May 1997, Amazon went public and by which time the company was only 2 years old with little revenue on its hand by
        following its motto of ‘get big, fast’. It had also adopted a system to enhance its security for safe
        information keeping of customer’s personal information by using what was created by the trio of California based
        mathematicians named Whitfield diffie, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle, we develop something called public key cryptography.
        While on the other hand, in the spring of 1998, eBay hired Meg Whitman, a Harvard MBA to be their businessperson to
        get Wall street to take them seriously and soon after in Sep 1998, eBay was scheduled to go public, though the
        founders were skeptical their stock soared that first day. This started the .com boom which shortly enough perpetuated
        the creation of other .com companies trying to follow pursuit of get big fast! Among all the forces propelling the
        .com boom, none was more profound than the democratization of the stock market with the .com bubble gradually
        growing.</p>

    <p>1999 was a wild year, almost impossible to fathom now, for the start of the boom in 1995, there had never been
        more than 30 internet companies to go public in any given year. In 1999, the total number of internet IPOs was 250.
        But eBay and Amazon stood head and shoulders above the rest of the.com crowd. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
        Federal Reserve Bank, decided to cool the bubble down in February of 2000 by raising their interest rates which
        put an end to the bubble. Eight years later to the day from April 14, 1912, the internet economy met a similar fate
        on woman forever after what was known on Wall Street as Black Friday. Five years later, the bitterness over the.com
        bubble has subsided.</p>
