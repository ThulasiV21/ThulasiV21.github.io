            <p>In a new phase of capitalism, the age of e commerce, using the world wide web was flourishing. Just like
                how most
                of the startups started in a garage, so did two companies called <span><b>Amazon.com</b></span> and <span><b>eBay</b></span> in this phase, back
                in the
                <span><b>1990s</b></span>, creating a whole new model of e-commerce. The business plan of Amazon, founded by <span><a href="Images/Jeff_Bezos.jpg" target="_blank" title="Jeff Bezos"><b>Jeff Bezos</b></a></span> and
                launched in the
                <span><b>summer of 1995</b></span>, was simple but very rewarding. What started as a platform for selling books is now the
                biggest
                e-commerce platform around the globe. During the same time, <span><a href="Images/Pierre_Omidyar.jpg" target="_blank" title="Pierre Omidyar"><b>Pierre Omidyar</b></a></span>, a software programmer
                founded eBay
                with a simple idea of making an online auction site for regular people making use of the web. The basic
                functions of
                Ebay were create an item, list an item, get a list of all the items that have been created, and bid on
                an item. Both
                companies cherished early successes right after their launch and their numbers increased exponentially
                quarter
                after quarter.</p>

            <p>This success is greatly explained by two laws working hand-in-hand, <span><b>Moore's law</b></span> and <span><b>Metcalfe's</b></span> law. In
                <span><b>May 1997</b></span>, Amazon went public and by which time the company was only 2 years old with little revenue on
                its hand by
                following its motto of <span><b>‘get big, fast’</b></span>. It had also adopted a system to enhance its security for safe
                information keeping of customer’s personal information by using what was created by the trio of
                California based
                mathematicians named <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie" target="_blank" title="Wiki page of Whitfield diffie"><b>Whitfield diffie</b></a></span>, <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hellman" target="_blank" title="Martin Hellman"><b>Martin Hellman</b></a></span>, and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle" target="_blank" title="Wiki page of Ralph Merkle"><b>Ralph Merkle</b></a></span>, we develop something called
                <span><b>public key cryptography</b></span>.
                While on the other hand, in the <span><b>spring of 1998</b></span>, eBay hired <span><a href="Images/Meg_Whitman.jpg" target="_blank" title="Meg Whitman"><b>Meg Whitman</b></a></span>, a Harvard MBA to be their
                businessperson to
                get Wall street to take them seriously and soon after in <span><b>Sep 1998</b></span>, eBay was scheduled to go public,
                though the
                founders were skeptical their stock soared that first day. This started the <span><b>.com boom</b></span> which shortly
                enough perpetuated
                the creation of other .com companies trying to follow pursuit of get big fast! Among all the forces
                propelling the
                .com boom, none was more profound than the democratization of the stock market with the .com bubble
                gradually
                growing.

            <p><span><b>1999 was a wild year</b></span>, almost impossible to fathom now, for the start of the <span><b>boom in 1995</b></span>, there had never
                been
                more than 30 internet companies to go public in any given year. In 1999, the total number of internet
                IPOs was 250.
                But eBay and Amazon stood head and shoulders above the rest of the.com crowd. <span><a href="Images/Alan_Greenspan.jpg" target="_blank" title="Alan Greenspan"><b>Alan Greenspan</b></a></span>, the
                chairman of the
                Federal Reserve Bank, decided to cool the bubble down in <span><b>February of 2000</b></span> by raising their interest
                rates which
                put an end to the bubble. Eight years later to the day from <span><b>April 14, 1912</b></span>, the internet economy met a
                similar fate
                on woman forever after what was known on Wall Street as <span><b>Black Friday</b></span>. Five years later, the bitterness
                over the.com
                bubble has subsided.</p>
