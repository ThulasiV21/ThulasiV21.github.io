            <p>In a time before Google, <span><b>Jan 1994</b></span>, two graduate students <span><a href="Images/Jerry_Yang.jpg" target="_blank" title="Jerry yang"><b>Jerry yang</b></a></span> and <span><a href="Images/David_Filo.jpg" target="_blank" title="David Filo"><b>David Filo</b></a></span>, while their professor was on
                vacation
                created and founded <span><b>‘Yahoo’</b></span> (coined later, was earlier known as ‘Jerry and David's guide to the
                World
                Wide Web’) which
                became a basis for one of America's best-known businesses. To expand this directory that could show
                virgin web
                users how to find cool stuff, into a business venture, they required huge funding. No capital
                venture
                wanted to
                invest in yahoo, when it started as they thought that they would not profit from it. <span><b>Late in ‘95</b></span>,
                Yahoo
                having no other
                option, then crossed their fingers and decided to support banner ads on their website to make
                revenue
                and
                surprisingly was a big hit. This made Yahoo the first company to have shown the possibility of
                making
                money on
                the web that started the web boom.</p>

            <p>By <span><b>1996</b></span>, Yahoo was up against a lot of its rivals on the same platform, one among them was a
                company
                named <span><b>‘Excite’</b></span>.
                Unlike Yahoo, excite was a pure software company, its service crawled the web finding pages that
                contained the
                typed in term, which became the rudimentary version of search today. In <span><b>1998</b></span>, <span><a href="Images/Larry_Page.jpg" target="_blank" title="Larry page"><b>Larry page</b></a></span> and
                <span><a href="Images/Sergey_Brin.jpg" target="_blank" title="Sergey Brin"><b>Sergey Brin</b></a></span>
                , built and
                put to an academic paper, Google, which started in <span><b>1996</b></span>. Google enhanced search by big folds
                which
                became the core
                of Google’s incredible success. Google used the concept of popularity votes by users to measure
                how
                important a link was.
                <span><a href="Images/Andy_Bechtolsheim.jpg" target="_blank" title="Andy bechtolsheim"><b>Andy bechtolsheim</b></a></span> invested in Google to expand it into a big company. In the sidelines, google
                copied an
                Idea from <span><b>Overture</b></span>
                founded by <span><a href="Images/Bill_Gross.jpg" target="_blank" title="Bill Gross"><b>Bill Gross</b></a></span>, a service to advertise effectively by molding it to their user’s
                benefits,
                which
                became the
                world's most powerful and efficient market research tool. Though Google walked away without
                striking
                a
                deal with Bill
                at first, they stroke a deal later when Bill filed a lawsuit against them. On <span><b>August 19, 2004</b></span>,
                Google
                went public listing
                its shares for sale on the NASDAQ stock market which made Google the fast-growing company
                ever.</p>
