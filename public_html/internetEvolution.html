            <p>In a time before Google, Jan 1994, two graduate students Jerry yang and David Filo, while their professor on
                vacation
                created and founded ‘Yahoo’ (coined later, was earlier known as ‘Jerry and David's guide to the
                World
                Wide Web’) which
                became a basis for one of America's best-known businesses. To expand this directory that could show
                virgin web
                users how to find cool stuff, into a business venture, they required huge funding. No capital
                venture
                wanted to
                invest in yahoo, when it started as they thought that they would not profit from it. Late in ‘95,
                Yahoo
                having no other
                option, then crossed their fingers and decided to support banner ads on their website to make
                revenue
                and
                surprisingly was a big hit. This made Yahoo the first company to have shown the possibility of
                making
                money on
                the web that started the web boom.</p>

            <p>By 1996, Yahoo was up against a lot of its rivals on the same platform, one among them was a
                company
                named ‘Excite’.
                Unlike Yahoo, excite was a pure software company, its service crawled the web finding pages that
                contained the
                typed in term, which became the rudimentary version of search today. In 1998, Larry page and
                Sergey
                Brin, built and
                put to an academic paper, Google, which started in 1996. Google enhanced search by big folds
                which
                became the core
                of Google’s incredible success. Google used the concept of popularity votes by users to measure
                how
                important a link was.
                Andy bechtolsheim invested in Google to expand it into a big company. In the sidelines, google
                copied an
                Idea from Overture
                founded by Bill Gross, a service to advertise effectively by molding it to their user’s
                benefits,
                which
                became the
                world's most powerful and efficient market research tool. Though Google walked away without
                striking
                a
                deal with Bill
                at first, they stroke a deal later when Bill filed a lawsuit against them. On August 19, 2004,
                Google
                went public listing
                its shares for sale on the NASDAQ stock market which made Google the fast-growing company
                ever.</p>
