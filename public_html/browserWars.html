                <p>In Fall of <span><b>1993</b></span>, <span><a href="Images/Marc_Andreessen.jpg" target="_blank" title="Marc Andreessen"><b>Marc Andreessen</b></a></span>, posted Mosaic, a graphical user interface to easily search the web,
                    online. It was
                    made freely downloadable, and it went viral fast, it made the use of internet a ubiquity. In the
                    same
                    period,
                    Microsoft, founded by <span><a href="Images/Bill_Gates.jpg" target="_blank" title="Bill gates"><b>Bill gates</b></a></span> and <span><a href="Images/Paul_Allen.jpg" target="_blank" title="Paul Allen"><b>Paul Allen</b></a></span> in <span><b>1975</b></span>, was already a big company who had owned
                    almost
                    90% of the
                    world’s PCs with their software. Microsoft had its own web browser called Microsoft network, not
                    made
                    free. <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Clark" target="_blank" title="Wiki page of Jim Clark"><b>Jim Clark</b></a></span> noticed how mosaic had millions of users over a period of just 9 months, he foresaw a big
                    business
                    potential.
                    He along with Marc put together a team called <span><b>Netscape</b></span>, who on <span><b>13th Oct 1994</b></span> developed and launched
                    a
                    web browser
                    descended from mosaic called the <span><b>‘Navigator’</b></span> which spread like wildfire. This caught the eye of Bill
                    gates as
                    Netscape was leading in web communications and was the fastest growing software communications by
                    then.
                    Bill gates
                    then send communication to all his employees to stop what they were working on and take a U-turn and
                    work on
                    developing web browser to defeat Netscape. In <span><b>June 1995</b></span>, Bill gates also set a meeting between
                    Microsoft
                    and
                    Netscape and till date no one knows what happened in the meeting, the versions of the meeting were
                    completely
                    opposite. <span><b>Aug 1995</b></span>, Netscape went public, and it was the biggest IPO until then. Behind the scenes,
                    during the same
                    time, Microsoft was developing their own web browser known today as the <span><b>‘Internet explorer’</b></span>, they
                    were
                    taking all
                    they got and attack Netscape, this was called the <span><b>Pearl harbor attack</b></span>. They also had their salesman
                    force all
                    Microsoft software owners to use IE only along with making IE free. <span><b>By Sep 1997</b></span>, the browser wars
                    was
                    over,
                    Microsoft came out victorious crushing Netscape to the grounds completely. In <span><b>1998</b></span>, US government
                    Department of
                    Justice, prodded by Microsoft’s enemies especially <span><a href="Images/Garry_Reback.jpg" target="_blank" title="Garry reback"><b>Garry reback</b></a></span>, Lawyer of Netscape launched
                    a historic
                    trust <span><b>lawsuit</b></span>
                    against Bill gates and his company, the verdict being guilty was to break down the company that
                    plunged
                    their stock
                    market share by 30 billion in value overnight. Eventually a federal’s appeal’s court rescinded the
                    order
                    to split
                    the company in two. As the trial concluded Gates stepped down as CEO.</p>
