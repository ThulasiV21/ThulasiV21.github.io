<h3>History</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the story of a boy named internet. It all started way back in the 1960’s when the then President of USA, Dwight D. Eisenhower, created a team called ARPA, who would take charge of space programs (which also included computer science) to beat the Russians on space research and technology. This space program was then taken over by NASA and the computer science research came to a dead end until a Graduate at MIT, J.C.R. Licklider came up with an idea of applying queueing theory to data transmission. The whole idea revolving around the concept on packages of data would queue or line up at the nodes of a communications network as they transited through. This helped him in detecting the overall speed of the network which he later improved using two techniques,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Demand access</li>
            <li>Distributed control</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Using the first technique he could let a node decide to receive information on demand, this helped to effectively share resource between data networks. The second technique meant that no one switch can control rather all switches should have shared control (it should decide the routing procedure, should decide how much traffic is allowed in, where it’s going).</p>
    <p>During the same time America was in midst of a war. Their soul communication during this period was through telephones and if this network was bombed the military were left stranded, unable to counterattack. To resolve this biggest issue, Paul Baran was hired, to build a communication network that was indestructible. After few experimental ideas, the team finally found the one that would work and formed the foundation for what now is called the ‘internet’. The idea was to chop up each message into small equal size pieces called packets, each packet was like a post card with a to and from add. These packets would traverse through the network from sender to receiver through already existing path and there would not be one dedicated path, and this was decided by the nodes throughout the packets’ journey. Unlike the post office, each node would keep a copy of the packets, which would be sent repeatedly until it successfully reached the next node. This idea was perfect because even if a path was destroyed, there were other paths these packets could traverse through unlike the telephone lines, where the whole network would collapse if one circuit was destroyed. By 1962, enough research was done to show a viable computer network could be built but implementing one had to wait 7 yrs until 1969. The first computer network stem from the frustrations of a single ARPA scientist Bob Taylor. Taylor along with Larry Roberts and with a little help from a fellow engineer built the first network design, the ARPANET, now popularly known as the ‘Internet’ and it was brought to life by BBN, a team that created the EMS for the ARPANET on Jan 1, 1969. On Sep 1, 1969, the first piece of hardware was created for the computer network. By the end of 1969, all the 4 sites (UCLA, Stanford, University of California at Santa Barbara and university of Utah) were interconnected, and ARPANET was a success! By April 1971, it had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network. Until now, ARPANET was used only to transfer files between systems until a new killer capability called the email was added to it. Raymond Samuel Tomlinson, in the same year created electronic mail, added this functionality to ARPANET and also gave the world a new icon, @. The ARPANET stayed the same with increasing networks until 20 years later, in 1973, two people Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up together to develop a set of rules or procedures known as TCP/IP protocol. This was finally perfected in 1983 and adopted as the universal standard, to interconnect all the disparate systems over the network, a common network of interconnected networks.</p>
    <p>The ARPANET was developed as a tool for defense research and restricted to select universities and think tanks engaged in government projects, but on June 9 1992, Congress passed a bill taking the internet out of exclusive hands of the government and into the public and following November, President Bush signed it into law.</p>
    <p>Around the same time the internet was used to look up information for research or come in a group to solve problems which was difficult until a physicist named Tim Berners Lee at the CERN research Institute created an easier way to search the web of contents. He developed a software that could more easily follow threads of knowledge within information stored throughout the internet. This Criss crossing of myriad threads of information across the globe over the internet reminded him of the web and hence named his software as the ‘World wide web’. This functionality was made even easier and user friendly to browse the world wide web through a software known as Mosaic. In 1993 at the University of Illinois by a 22-year-old student named Marc Andreessen developed Mosaic, which was later commercialized by Netscape, became the very signature of today’s internet.</p>

<h3>Browser wars</h3>
    <h4 class="adjust-margin">Microsoft vs Netscape</h4>
    <p>In Fall of 1993, Marc Andreessen, posted Mosaic, a graphical user interface to easily search the web, online. It was made freely downloadable, and it went viral fast, it made the use of internet a ubiquity. In the same period, Microsoft, founded by Bill gates and Paul Allen in 1975, was already a big company who had owned almost 90% of the world’s PCs with their software. Microsoft had its own web browser called Microsoft network, not made free. Jim Clark noticed how mosaic had millions of users over a period of just 9 months, he foresaw a big business potential. He along with Marc put together a team called Netscape, who on 13th Oct 1994 developed and launched a web browser descended from mosaic called the ‘Navigator’ which spread like wildfire. This caught the eye of Bill gates as Netscape was leading in web communications and was the fastest growing software communications by then. Bill gates then send communication to all his employees to stop what they were working on and take a U-turn and work on developing web browser to defeat Netscape. In June 1995, Bill gates also set a meeting between Microsoft and Netscape and till date no one knows what happened in the meeting, the versions of the meeting were completely opposite. Aug 1995, Netscape went public, and it was the biggest IPO until then. Behind the scenes, during the same time, Microsoft was developing their own web browser known today as the ‘Internet explorer’, they were taking all they got and attack Netscape, this was called the Pearl harbor attack. They also had their salesman force all Microsoft software owners to use IE only along with making IE free. By Sep 1997, the browser wars was over, Microsoft came out victorious crushing Netscape to the grounds completely. In 1998, US government Department of Justice, prodded by Microsoft’s enemies especially Garry reback, Lawyer of Netscape launched historic trust lawsuit against Bill gates and his company, the verdict being guilty was to break down the company that plunged their stock market share by 30 billion in value overnight. Eventually a federal’s appeal’s court rescinded the order to split the company in two. As the trial concluded Gates stepped down as CEO.</p>

<h3>Internet Search Evolution</h3>
    <h4 class="adjust-margin">Yahoo vs Google</h4>
    <p>In a time before Google, Jan 1994, two graduates Jerry yang and David Filo, while their professor on vacation created and founded ‘Yahoo’ (coined later, was earlier known as ‘Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web’) which became a basis for one of America's best-known businesses. To expand this directory that could show virgin web users how to find cool stuff, into a business venture, they required lot of funding. No capital venture wanted to invest in yahoo in the start as they didn’t seem it to be a serious promising idea. Late in ‘95, Yahoo having no other option, then crossed their fingers and decided to support banner ads on their website to make revenue and surprisingly was a big hit. This made Yahoo the first company to have shown the possibility of making money on the web that started the web boom. By 1996, yahoo was up against a lot of its rivals on the same platform, one among them was a company named ‘Excite’. Unlike Yahoo, excite was a pure software company, its service crawled the web finding pages that contained the typed in term, which became the rudimentary version of search today. In 1998, Larry page and Sergey Brin, built and put to an academic paper, Google, which started in 1996. Google enhanced search by big folds which became the core of Google’s incredible success. Google used the concept of popularity votes by users to measure how important a link was. Andy bechtolsheim invested in Google to expand it into a big company. In the sidelines, google copied an Idea from Overture founded by Bill Gross, a service to advertise effectively by molding it to their user’s benefits, which became the world's most powerful and efficient market research tool. Though Google walked away without striking a deal with Bill at first, they stroke a deal later when Bill filed a lawsuit against them. On August 19, 2004, Google went public listing its shares for sale on the NASDAQ stock market which made Google the fast-growing company ever.</p>

<h3>The dot com bubble</h3>
    <h4 class="adjust-margin">Amazon.com vs Ebay.com</h4>
    <p>In a new phase of capitalism, the age of e commerce, using the world wide web was flourishing. Just like how most of the startups started in a garage, so did two companies called Amazon.com and eBay in this phase, back in the 1990s, creating a whole new model of e-commerce. The business plan of Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos and launched in the summer of 1995, was simple but very rewarding. What started as a platform for selling books is now the biggest e-commerce platform around the globe. During the same time, Pierre Omidyar, a software programmer founded eBay with a simple idea of making an online auction site for regular people making use of the web. The basic functions of Ebay were create an item, list an item, get a list of all the items that have been created, and bid on an item. Both companies cherished early successes right after their launch and their numbers increased exponentially quarter after quarter. This success is greatly explained by two laws working hand-in-hand, Moore's law and Metcalfe's law. In May 1997, Amazon went public and by which time the company was only 2 years old with little revenue on its hand by following its motto of ‘get big, fast’. It had also adopted a system to enhance its security for safe information keeping of customer’s personal information by using what was created by the trio of California based mathematicians named Whitfield diffie, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle, we develop something called public key cryptography. While on the other hand, in the spring of 1998, eBay hired Meg Whitman, a Harvard MBA to be their businessperson to get Wall street to take them seriously and soon after in Sep 1998, eBay was scheduled to go public, though the founders were skeptical their stock soared that first day. This started the .com boom which shortly enough perpetuated the creation of other .com companies trying to follow pursuit of get big fast! Among all the forces propelling the .com boom, none was more profound than the democratization of the stock market with the .com bubble gradually growing. 1999 was a wild year, almost impossible to fathom now, for the start of the boom in 1995, there had never been more than 30 internet companies to go public in any given year. In 1999, the total number of internet IPOs was 250. But eBay and Amazon stood head and shoulders above the rest of the.com crowd. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, decided to cool the bubble down in February of 2000 by raising their interest rates which put an end to the bubble. Eight years later to the day from April 14, 1912, the internet economy met a similar fate on woman forever after what was known on Wall Street as Black Friday. Five years later, the bitterness over the.com bubble has subsided.</p>

<h3>The People who made www famous</h3>
    <h4 class="adjust-margin">Napster vs Music companies</h4>
    <p>With the uprising of the uses of the world wide web so did the communications. Chad Hurley, Kevin Rose, and Jay Adelson are among the leaders of the web 2.0 revolution who were on a mission to change the world through web enabled people power. Rosen Adelson, the co-founder of Digg, a social news website whose content is chosen by the devoted user community of millions, giving power to users to vote for their content. Chad Hurley, the co-founder of YouTube, the online video sharing service that we even today extensively use it and was bought by Google in 2006. Not only did YouTube give voices to regular people it also gave them power to express and broadcast themselves. The guys at both YouTube and Digg are believers in a theory known as the wisdom of crowds. Another person very much worth the mention is Mark Zuckerberg, founder of the social networking site Facebook which was spreading fast amongst the people. Meanwhile, 4 college nerds tucked away in college dorms, David Weekley, Justin Frankel, Cable Sasser and Steve Frank, music enthusiasts themselves came up with an idea of sharing music files as mp3 around the web, which marked the beginning of the music revolution. Along the same lines, an 18-year-old from Boston, Shawn Fanning founded Napster back in 1999. The whole idea behind Napster was to connect different computers over a network where one could freely share and download music as mp3 files. June 1999 once launched, where Napster was supposed to be shared with few friends, within a week it had 10,000 user downloads. It took over 75 to 80% of the available bandwidth of many US universities. less than four months after Fannie released it, Napster passed the million-download mark, making it the fastest spreading software ever. This success of Napster was noticed by Hilary Rosen, the head of the Recording Industry Association of America who contacted Napster to inform them what they were doing was illegal and the copyrighted songs had to be taken down and filed a lawsuit against Napster, one that promise to have profound implications for the role of copyright in the digital age. During the same time, Howard King and Peter Paterno top Los Angeles entertainment lawyers decided to take down Napster as they foresaw the threat the music industry would face if Napster flourished at the pace that it was.  July 2001, a verdict was rendered, Napster had to be shut down immediately. On the other hand, it encouraged Steve Jobs and Apple to create the iTunes music store where songs were sold for 99 cents apiece. After 2 years, in mid 2003, Christa Wolf and Tom Anderson founded a glorified dating app that rose and fell quickly, called Myspace. The initial popularity of Myspace had a lot to do with sharing and accessing music. By the spring of 2005, the site had gone through the roof, attracting 27 million registered users growing at a blistering pace, and overtaking even the web's reigning Colossus in terms of monthly traffic. Following July Myspace was taken over by News Corp. Companies like Craigslist and Wikipedia started flourishing by giving access to users to a lot of information for free.</p>
