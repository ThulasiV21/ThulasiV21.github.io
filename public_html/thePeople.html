            <p>With the uprising of the uses of the world wide web so did the communications. <span><a href="Images/Chad_Hurley.jpg" target="_blank" title="Chad Hurley"><b>Chad Hurley</b></a></span>, <span><a href="Images/Kevin_Rose.jpg" target="_blank" title="Kevin Rose"><b>Kevin Rose</b></a></span>,
                and <span><a href="Images/Jay_Adelson.jpg" target="_blank" title="Jay Adelson"><b>Jay Adelson</b></a></span> are among the leaders of the web 2.0 revolution who were on a mission to change the
                world
                through web enabled people power. Rose and Adelson, the co-founder of <span><b>Digg</b></span>, a social news website whose
                content
                is chosen by the devoted user community of millions, giving power to users to vote for their content.
                Chad
                Hurley, the co-founder of <span><b>YouTube</b></span>, the online video sharing service that we even today extensively use
                it and was
                bought by Google in <span><b>2006</b></span>. Not only did YouTube give voices to regular people it also gave them power to
                express and
                broadcast themselves. The guys at both YouTube and Digg are believers in a theory known as the wisdom of
                crowds.</p>

            <p>A person very much worth the mention is <span><a href="Images/Mark_Zuckerberg.jpg" target="_blank" title="Mark Zuckerberg"><b>Mark Zuckerberg</b></a></span>, founder of the social networking site Facebook
                which was spreading fast amongst the people. Meanwhile, 4 college nerds tucked away in college dorms,
                <span><b>David Weekley</b></span>
                , <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Frankel" target="_blank" title="Wiki page of Justin Frankel"><b>Justin Frankel</b></a></span>, <span><a href="Images/Cable_Sasser.jpg" target="_blank" title="Cable Sasser"><b>Cable Sasser</b></a></span> and <span><b>Steve Frank</b></span>, music enthusiasts themselves came up with an idea
                of
                sharing music files as mp3 around the web, which marked the beginning of the music revolution.</p>

            <p>Along the same lines, an 18-year-old from Boston, <span><a href="Images/Shawn_Fanning.jpg" target="_blank" title="Shawn Fanning"><b>Shawn Fanning</b></a></span> founded <span><b>Napster</b></span> back in <span><b>1999</b></span>. The whole
                idea behind Napster was to connect different computers over a network where one could freely share and
                download music as mp3 files. June 1999 once launched, where Napster was supposed to be shared with few
                friends,
                within a week it had 10,000 user downloads. It took over 75 to 80% of the available bandwidth of many US
                universities. less than four months after Fannie released it, Napster passed
                the million-download mark, making it the fastest spreading software ever. This success of Napster was
                noticed by <span><a href="Images/Hilary_Rosen.jpg" target="_blank" title="Hilary Rosen"><b>Hilary Rosen</b></a></span>, the head of the Recording Industry Association of America who contacted Napster
                to inform
                them what they were doing was illegal and the copyrighted songs had to be taken down and filed a lawsuit
                against
                Napster, one that promise to have profound implications for the role of copyright in the digital age.
                During the same
                time, <span><b>Howard King</b></span> and <span><b>Peter Paterno</b></span> top Los Angeles entertainment lawyers decided to take down Napster
                as they
                foresaw the threat the music industry would face if Napster flourished at the pace that it was. <span><b>July 2001</b></span>
                , a
                verdict was rendered, Napster had to be shut down immediately.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, it encouraged <span><b>Steve Jobs</b></span> and Apple to create the iTunes music store where songs were
                sold for 99 cents apiece. After 2 years, in <span><b>mid 2003</b></span>, <span><a href="Images/Chris_DeWolfe.jpg" target="_blank" title="Chris DeWolf"><b>Chris DeWolf</b></a></span> and <span><a href="Images/Tom_Anderson.jpg" target="_blank" title="Tom Anderson"><b>Tom Anderson</b></a></span>
                 founded a glorified dating app that rose and fell quickly, called <span><b>Myspace</b></span>. The initial
                popularity
                of Myspace had a lot to do with sharing and accessing music. By the <span><b>spring of 2005</b></span>, the site had gone
                through the
                roof, attracting 27 million registered users growing at a blistering pace, and overtaking even the web's
                reigning Colossus in terms of monthly traffic. Following July Myspace was taken over by <span><b>News Corp</b></span>.
                Companies like Craigslist and Wikipedia started flourishing by giving access to users to a lot of
                information for free. The number of application since then has been booming following the linear
                graph.</p>
